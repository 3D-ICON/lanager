Short Term
-------------------------------------------------------
Links
    Position - left to right, or position in dropdown if child
    Title - user entered so no need for i18n
    URL - absolute
    Parent - ID of parent, to appear in dropdown under. only one level of nesting
Links - Caching to reduce queries
Fix:
    steam_user_apps import
    extra queries when checking permissions - caching?
Profile - games in common
